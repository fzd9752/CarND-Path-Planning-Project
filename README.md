## Reflection

### TODO & Complete

- [x] Speed Limit: -10 MPH ~ 50MPH
- [x] Total acceleration < 10 m/s^2
- [x] Jerk 10 m/s^3
- [x] Keep driving in the middle of a lane
- [x] Change lane according to the sensor fusion and environment info.
- [x] At least 5 miles automotive driving without collison

### Process to make a path planner

In this project, I practice to create a path planner, which includes behaviour planning and trajectory generator.

#### Behaviour Planning -- Finite States Machine

I create a FSM in respect of the simulator info. This is a tricky design of the FSM in this project. Because the simulator only have 3 lanes, and there is no requirement to turn over, I gave up the traditional method of designning states as `keep lane`, `turn left`, `turn right`. I designed the states as `lane left`, `lane middle`, `lane right`. This could help save the time and code to create next possible states for the car. Each `lane` could change to `lane 1` and their own `lane`. Only `lane 1` can change to `lane 0` and `lane 2`.

#### Trajectory Generator

I use `spline.h` library to generate possible trajectories for the FSM states, which fits a cubic polynomial lane according to the reference points (includes start points and relative points). Then, use the polynomial function to generate map x and y points during the interval time (0.02s). Cubic polynomial generator is a really simple and effective method to generate the trajectories, but there're some disadvatages about it. First, the polynomial function it generated could only calculate the positon based on time, but not including the accelerator and speed info. Comparing to `JMT` , it needs another method to calculate the relative speed and can't minimise the jerk.

#### Cost function

Here is not a direct cost funtion series I used to limit and choose final trajectory. I use a tricky `buffer` to decide if the ego car should start to change lane, then I calculate the distance between ego car and each othe vehicles, and divide distances to ahead vehicles and after vehicles. The ego vehicle chooses the trajectory with longest distance and avoid the collision.

### Improvments & Future

Here are many things that can do to improve the path planning. For instance, using JMT or A* to generate trajectories, adding prepare lane change to the FMS status. Also, the sensor fusion data could be handle more detailed. Currently, I didn't use contrast lane vehicles' data. There is less but not no possibility that the contrast lane vehicle cross the middle lane. That will be interesting, if a vehicle could prevent and perform well in that situation.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
